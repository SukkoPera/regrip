Regrip TODO list:
- Support MP3 through LAME
- Support M4A through FAAC (Basically AAC with a different container)
- Support Opus (initial encoder is there, but is not working correctly. I hate having to fit the stream in the container)
- Make encoders configurable (some GSettings stuff is there, need more and GUIs)
- Consider plugin architecture, maybe using libpeas: main issue is that libpeas seems to only support GTK3 for plugin configuration GUIs
- Switch to libcddb for CDDB support (Almost there)
- Add MusicBrainz support 
- Add Discogs support
- Use libcdio for CD playing functions.
- Add AccurateRip support
- Use DBus (maybe through GIO/GDrive) to autodetect CD drives and media insertion/ejection, instead of polling drives directly.
- Make external library of the gain analysis part
- Remove any code specific to the Solaris port (not necessary, but I cannot test that, plus relaying on external library also aims at making any explicit support unnecessary)
- Switch to GtkBuilder (added initial stuff, already used for multiple CDDB reults dialog)
- Reorganize GUI (Preferences should have their own separate dialog, as the ripping process should, not to mention program credits. A toolbar and a status bar might also be handy)

Changes completed in Regrip:
- Switch to CMake
- Use GSettings for user settings
- Remove support for cdda2wav and external cdparanoia, only support libcdparanoia
- Remove ability to rip and encode separately: this probably made sense when computers were slow, but since now encoding is faster than realtime I really see no need for that.
- Refactor encoding process
- Support WAV/OGG/FLAC through libsndfile
- Support AAC through FAAC
- Replace ID3Lib with TagLib. This would allow to put tags in OGG and FLAC files as well as MP3s.

Original Grip TODO list:
 o add ability to browse for rip/encode executables (no longer necessary)
 o overall progress indicator for multi-track rips (no longer necessary)
 o abort current track from multi-track rip (no longer necessary)
 o command-line arguments for batch operation
 o some way to get the track name in condensed mode (perhaps a tooltip?)
 o display/edit extended DiscDB info
 o allow ejecting when the tray is closed, but with no disc
 o slider to move within a track
 o add a timeout for DiscDB lookup (no longer necessary)
 o check rip/encode result status and repeat if necessary
 o avoid locking of drive
 o update the track time properly when paused and the track is changed
 o update the playtime during ripping/encoding?
 o digital playing of cds (through CDDA)
 o allow per-song year specification?
 o better display of cdparanoia error status
 o size info as tooltip on rip/encode progress bar
 o remember previous position when smart-relocating on expand
 o support multiple cdrom drives? (no longer necessary)
 o remember Disk Editor toggle status
 o ask if the whole disc should be ripped if no track is selected (done)
 o add an option "CD eject program" (no longer necessary when we switch to libcdio)
 o allow different file format for multi-artist cds
