Regrip
======

Regrip is a cd-player and cd-ripper for the Linux desktop. It has the ripping
capabilities of cdparanoia builtin and provides output modules for many common
file formats, both lossy, such as MP3, OGG, Opus, and lossless, such as WAV and
FLAC, letting you take a disc and transform it easily straight into your
favorite format. Internet disc lookups are also supported for retrieving track
information from disc database servers.

Regrip is a fork of Grip, a once-famous CD player for the GNOME desktop:

Requirements
============

To use Regrip, you must have:

 o A computer with a CD/DVD-Rom drive (Surprise, surprise!)
 o A modern Linux distribution with GTK+ 2.0 and several other libraries (It
   might also work under other Unix-like systems, but this has not yet been
   tested)
 o A net connection (if you want to use disc database lookup)

Regrip uses several external libraries. The following is a list of libraries
required for proper operation on a recent Ubuntu system:

 o libgtk2.0
 o libvte
 o libcdparanoia

Support for file tagging is optional and relies on TagLib,
http://taglib.github.io:
 o libtagc0

To produce something useful, you will also need an output module, each of which
has it own requirements:
 
WAV/OGG/FLAC output module:
 o libsndfile1 (http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/)
 
AAC output module:
 o libfaac (http://www.audiocoding.com/faac.html)

Opus output module (currently broken):
 o libopus (http://opus-codec.org)
 o libsamplerate0 (http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/)


Installation
============

If you obtained Regrip through the package management system of your
distribution, there is probably nothing more to do. If you want to compile
from sources, you will need to make sure that the software development packages
are available on your system. On an Ubuntu system this means:

 o build-essential
 o cmake
 o -dev packages of the packages listed under "Requirements"

Then you will need to go through the following steps:

 o Unpack Regrip and cd to the extracted directory
 o 'mkdir BUILD'
 o 'cd BUILD'
 o 'cmake ..'
 o 'make'
 o 'sudo make install'

For options to the configure process, run (before the 'make' step):

  make edit_cache
